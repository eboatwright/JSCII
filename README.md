# Announcement!
 I'm putting this project on hold, because I remembered how much I don't like working with JavaScript. (Please don't take offense, it's just my preference.) Thanks for all the support, and you guys can fix, or add stuff if you want and I'll accept pull requests. Thank you!

# JSCII
 An ASCII (technically PETSCII :)) "Game Engine" / toolkit for JavaScript!<br>
 I'm using the Commodore 64's PETSCII character set, and color palette!<br>
 The one liberty I game myself, is the screen resolution. While the Commodore had 320x200, I'm using 480x300.

# Usage
 Copy the jscii.js file into your directory, and load it into your HTML file!<br>
 If you want more "Game Engine"-ey type stuff, also put in the extras.js file :D<br>
 JSCII doesn't force you to use the Level, and Entity system. You can do *everything* however you want!<br>

# Disclaimer
 Some things (mostly in the extras) are NOT finished, and will be worked on!<br>
 Others, will change *frequently* so if you're planning on using this, I suggest downloading a version, then keeping the same version. (Unless you want to refactor your code every week)
