# JSCII
 An ASCII (technically PETSCII :)) "Game Engine" / toolkit for JavaScript!<br>
 I'm using the Commodore 64's PETSCII character set, and color palette!<br>
 The one liberty I game myself, is the screen resolution. While the Commodore had 320x200, I'm using 480x300.

# Usage
 Copy the jscii.js file into your directory, and load it into your HTML file!<br>
 If you want more "Game Engine"-ey type stuff, also put in the extras.js file :D<br>
 JSCII doesn't force you to use the Level, and Entity system. You can do *everything* however you want!

# Disclaimer
 Some things (mostly in the extras) are NOT finished, and will be worked on!<br>
 Others, will change *frequently* so if you're planning on using this, I suggest downloading a version, then keeping the same version. (Unless you want to refactor your code every week)
