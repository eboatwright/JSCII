The bugs list is self-explanatory

The main todo list, is for things that will be in the main jscii.js file.
So, things that you probably* don't want to write yourself.

The extras todo list, is for things that you probably will want to write yourself.
So, things like spell systems you will probably want to write yourself, to fit your own game.

The maybe list, is just things that I might've had suggestions for, or thought of myself,
that I might not want to add.
